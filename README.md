# ChillZam!
 Use the Shazam API to detect the song currently playing on a Twitch stream.

 This tool uses [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/) to record a few seconds of a specified Twitch stream, then it converts the audio to the format required by the [Shazam API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam).

 You will need to find out your Twitch GQL OAuth token. This token is different from the traditional Helix Twitch API token. If you need help finding the token check out this issue from the Streamlink github:
 
  [How do I get a Twitch OAuth token to authenticate my requests?](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/discussions/4400)


You will also need to generate a Shazam API key as well. Shazam has a free tier that allows 500 requests per month. Head over to the [Shazam Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam) page and subscribe to it. You will automatically get a key.

ChillZam uses FFmpeg to convert the audio to the Shazam format. If you have FFmpeg on your system already, just specify the path to it in the config file. If a path is not specified it will look in your PATH to see if its there. If its not in the config OR the PATH, it will attempt to use the binary in the `/bin` directory. This works for Windows and Mac. If you are on a Linux system you will need to install FFmpeg using your package manager.

The script needs a config file to operate. This config file can be specified at the command link or just include a config.json file adjacent to the script. The config file has the following format:

```json
{
    "twitch_channel": "https://www.twitch.tv/somestreamer",
    "twitch_gql_oauth_token": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "shazam_api_key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "ffmpeg_path": "",
    "kbytes_to_record": 200,
    "show_requests_remaining", true
}
```

The only field not mentioned yet is `kbytes_to_record`. 200KB is a good starting point. If its not identifying any songs, try to bump that number up. The max size that Shazam supports is 500kb.

To use, clone the repository and run pip install on the requirements.txt file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chillfactor032/chillzam.git
cd chillzam
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Be sure to create the config file, then run the script

```bash
py chillzam.py
```

For Mac or Linux you may need to use `python` or `python3` instead of `py`. 

Thanks!
