# ChillZam! GUI Help

If you wish to run this tool as a standalone GUI, an executable will be available in the release section. 

## Twitch Channel

This is simple the name of the Twitch channel you want ChillZam to listen to. If the url of the channel is "https://twitch.tv/shoud", then the channel name is simple "shroud".

## Getting a Twitch GPL Auth token

If you log into Twitch on your browser, you will have a Twitch GPL Auth Token in your cookies. How you view these is Browser dependent.

### Chrome

In Chrome, navigate to https://twitch.tv. When the page loads press F12 to bring up the DevTools. Navigate to the "Application" tab and then in the left bar select "Cookies" > "https://gpl,twitch.tv". The list of cookies for that domain will appear. Find the one named "auth-token" and double click it. Copy the value to your clipboard and paste it in the settings dialog in ChillZam!

### Firefox

In Firefox, navigate to https://twitch.tv. When the page loads press F12 to bring up the DevTools. Navigate to the "Storage" tab and then in the left bar select "Cookies" > "https://gpl,twitch.tv". The list of cookies for that domain will appear. Find the one named "auth-token" and double click it. Copy the value to your clipboard and paste it in the settings dialog in ChillZam!
Thanks!

## Shazam API Key

You will need to generate your own Shazam API Key. You will need to first create a RapidAPI account before you can subscribe to the API. Once you have an account created, navigate to "https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam". Click the "Subscribe to Test" button. Select the "Basic" (Free) package which gets you 500 requests per month. You should see a message like "Subscription Created Successfully". Naviage back to "https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam" and now you should see your API Key under a field called "X-RapidAPI-Key". Copy this value and paste it into the settings dialog in ChillZam!
